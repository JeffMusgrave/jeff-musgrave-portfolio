# jeff-musgrave-portfolio

## What you'll find:

There are two main folders in this repo. The "html-css" folder contains HTML/CSS prototypes based on my initial Figma design ideas. The primary purpose of this stage of development was to test out different content presentation ideas and CSS rendering techniques. For example: should the website display content requiring the user to scroll to see more, or limit scrolling by implementing a tab based UI? 

I decided to pursue a "single page application" featuring tabs on each page to limit scrolling. You can find that code in the "jm-react-site" folder. The master branch is used to build the active porftolio website via Netlify, which you can find here: [www.jeffmusgrave.com](https://www.jeffmusgrave.com).
