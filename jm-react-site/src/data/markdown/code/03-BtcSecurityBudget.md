# Bitcoin Security Budget

Designed in Figma and implemented using Next.js, Chakra-ui, Framer-Motion, and Chart.js.

This project delves into the security implications of a rapidly declining bitcoin subsidy for miners, and whether or not transaction fees will be enough to secure the network and maintain its coveted decentralized, censorship resistant status.

It's complete with interactive graphs, modifyable settings, and explanations of the problem and some potential solutionsâ€”and fantastic memes of course.
