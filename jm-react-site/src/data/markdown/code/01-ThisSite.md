# My Website

While browsing this website, you might have noticed that it flows more smoothly than most websites do. That unique flowing effect is made possible by some sophisticated custom code. Examples of that code can be seen on this web page.

No matter how challenging your project is, my extensive coding knowledge will enable me to produce the professional results that you need.

This site is powered by open source libraries including:

- React
- Styled-Components
- Framer Motion
