# Stop Motion Animation

This “claymation” animated video was created with plasticine, wire, and a technique known as "stop motion". This involved photographing small changes in the characters and sets, one frame at a time. After taking thousands of photos like this, I sequenced and edited them to create a fluid video. My work in this project entailed:

- Storyboarding
- Animation
- Editing
- Color grading
