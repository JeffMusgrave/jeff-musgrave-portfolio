## Stop Motion Animation

This “claymation” animated video was created with plasticine, wire, and a technique known as stop motion. This involved photographing small changes in sets and characters one frame at a time. Later I assembled thousands of photos and edited the collection to create a fluid video. My involvement included:

- Storyboarding
- Animation
- Editing
- Color grading
