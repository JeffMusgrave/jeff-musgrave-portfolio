# Visuals from a Neural Net

Here is a reel of some live action videos I shot. After shooting the videos, I employed specialized machine learning technology to create an animated, “rotoscoped” appearance. This customized "style transfer" technique makes these videos look surreal and painterly. My work in this project involved:

- storyboarding
- filming
- automating style transfer libraries with Bash
- coding javascript to automate Adobe Photoshop
- color grading and editing footage in Adobe Premiere.
- processing footage with style transfer and super slow motion software.
