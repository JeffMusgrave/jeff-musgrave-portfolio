I have created videos in many styles. For special effects, I have sometimes utilized machine learning. The result can be surreal, painterly visuals, as you can see on this webpage. This project involved:

- storyboarding,
- filming,
- automating style transfer libraries with Bash,
- coding javascript for to automate photoshop,
- and color grading and editing footage in adobe premiere cc.
- Style transfer / super slow motion
