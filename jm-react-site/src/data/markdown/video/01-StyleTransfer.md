## Machine Learning Style Transfer

Here is a video reel of some live action videos I shot, and transformed into an animated, “rotoscoped” style. To achieve this, I utilized a machine learning method known as style transfer. The result can be surreal, painterly visuals. This project involved:

- storyboarding,
- filming,
- automating style transfer libraries with Bash,
- coding javascript for to automate photoshop,
- and color grading and editing footage in adobe premiere cc.
- Style transfer / super slow motion
