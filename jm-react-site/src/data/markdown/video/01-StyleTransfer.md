# Visuals from a Neural Net

Here is a reel of some live action videos I shot. After shooting the videos, I employed specialized machine learning technology to create an animated, “rotoscoped” appearance. This "style transfer" technique makes these videos look surreal and painterly. My work in this project involved:

- storyboarding,
- filming,
- automating style transfer libraries with Bash,
- coding javascript for to automate photoshop,
- and color grading and editing footage in adobe premiere cc.
- Style transfer / super slow motion
